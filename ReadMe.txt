BETA EDITION

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|Setup|

|-BNCS_Accounts.txt-|
Place all your accounts that you want to use to login in on through battle.net in here.
Place each account by User//Pass  - // seperating the username and password on each line.
*Note* Each BNCS account should be different or else MCP won't allow you to load that bot.


|-D2DV_Keys.txt & D2XP_Keys.txt-|
Place each key in the approatiate text file, one cdkey per line. D2 keys go in D2DV_Keys.txt
and D2 Expansion go in D2XP_Keys.txt
*Note* CDKeys will rotate if they are banned, invalidly hashed, or a wrong product automatically.


|-Loading Character names you want to create-|
Make all your account lists in the same folder as the bot. Once you launch the bot you can 
then select which account uses which account list in the Settings section. Clicking Apply
will then load all those account lists to the specified accounts.


|-Invalid.txt-|
Any invalid character names that MCP returns will be put in here.


|-Created.txt-|
Any characters created will be put in here with the format of BNCSName => CharName.



[[[[ Getting Started ]]]]

When you first startup the bot and if you have never used it before the Settings window will
pop up along with some info on bot screen of what's missing. 

-On the Settings Window-
::In the Server box, put which battle.net server you want to connect to.
::In the Verbyte box, put the current version byte (ex: 0D)
::In the Spawn box, place the amount bots you want to launch. Number of spawns should be 
less than or equal to how many BNCS names you have loaded.  

:: In order to load Character lists to specified names click on the given BNCS name and then
click browse.  Then you will select which account list, these lists must be in the same directory as the bot itself.
Once you have done that click set button.

Once you have completed all your Settings, click Apply.  
Clicking Apply will save everything and once you exit and reload your bot again, it will have all those settings saved. You just need to reload account lists by clicking apply in Settings.

-On the Main Window-
Now that all Settings are saved select which character type and class you want. Remember you can only use Druid and Assassain with Expansion.
Then click Start to connect.

32bit systems: Copy .dlls/.ocx or any other needed files in /System
